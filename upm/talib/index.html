# About

- Master thesis for BRNO University of Technology
- Written by Ondřej Lengál


> The aim of this work is to design an efficient library that would be suitable for sophisticated tree model checking techniques while being flexible enough to be used even for methods which have not yet been developed.

# Timbuk

- Collection of tools for Term Rewriting Systems and Tree Automata
- Version 3.1 is latest (2.2 is the latest with TA)
- Written i OCaml by IRISA
- The code is open source (GNU LGPL v2)
- Tree automatons are implemented as tuple of lists

![Timbuk](./img/timbuk.svg)

???
- IRISA is a French research insitute that focuses on computer science and informatics.
- 2.2 Version is patched by Ondreij to run a newer OCaml version.
- The code is open source, and the author states that he studied the implementation.
- The tuple consists of: 
  - a list of symbols (an alphabet)
  - a list of state operators
  - a list of states
  - a list of final states
  - a list of transitions
  - a list of prioritary transitions
- Timbuk implements the "standard" operations:
  - Intersection
  - Union
  - Language emptiness
  - deletion of inaccessible states
  - Determinisation
  - others
- Timbuk can construct a tree automaton directly from a given term rewriting system.

# MONA

- Solves decision procedures for WS1S and WS2S
- Tree automata is a part of their "secrets"
  - More accuretly, the representation
  - Introduces MTBDD
- Guided tree automaton
- Eager minimisation
- MONA only supports deterministic finite tree automata
- The code is open source (GNU GPLv2)
- Written in C/C++ by BRICS/Aarhus University

.img50r[
    ![Tree](./img/tree.svg)
]

???
- WS1S (Weak monadic Second-order theory of 1 successor)
- WS2S (Weak monadic Second-order theory of 2 successors)
- MONA is heavily optimized of the years, and a co-author claims that MONA is tuned to give the "best" performance.
- MTBDD will be discussed more indept in the design part.
- Guided tree automaton helps tackle state space blow-up.
  - Bottom-up tree automate often suffer from the lack of position information in the tree.
  - Guided tree automaton provides a guide, an additional top-down TA that labels tree nodes with state spaces (aware of position).
  - This is done before the automaton startes working.
- Eager minimisation
  - When the automaton is modified, a Myhill-Nerode minimisation is performed
    - Myhill-Nerode: TODO
  - Yielded unexpected good results.
  - MONA uses DAGs for representations instead of trees to representate formulae.
- AT&T is also apart of the collaboration

# Minor libraries

- Lethal
  - Written in Java
  - Naive implementation with focus on education
  - Supports standard operations
  - Only library that implements tree transducers and hedge automata
- Binary Tree Automata Library
  - Written in Caml
  - Implements basic functions
  - Similar to Timbuk
  - Uses hash tables to represent transition tables

???
- Tree tranducers: TODO 
- Hedge automata: TODO

# Analysis
## Abstract Regular Tree Model Checking

Regular tree model checking: 
τ∗ (L(Init)) ∩ L(Bad) = ∅

- Abstract regular tree model checking
- Abstraction based on languages of finite height
- Abstraction based on predicate languages


???
- Where _Init_ is a tree automaton denoting the set of initial states of the system.
- Where _Bad_ is a tree automaton expressing the set of states violating the safety properties of the system.
- Where τ is a linear tree transducer representing the transition relation of the system.

- Abstract RTMC is a acceleration technique based on the _abstract-check-refine_ paradigm
- Abstraction based on languages of finite height, defines two states of a tree automaton as equivalent if their languages up to a given height n are identical. Similar to Myhill-Nerode.
- Abstraction based on predicate languages defines two states of a tree automaton equivalent if their languages have a nonempty intersection with exactly the same subset of languages represented by tree automata from P.

---
# Analysis (2)
## Requirements

- Create finite tree automaton denoting the:
  - Union
  - Intersection
  - Complement
- Determinisation of a finite tree automaton
- Minimasation of a finite tree automaton
- Reducing the size of a nondeterministic finite tree automaton
- Determining inclusion of languages of given finite automata
- Tree transducers in structure-perserving form
- The ability to efficiently traverse all states in order

???
- creating a finite tree automaton denoting the union of languages of given finite tree automata
- creating a finite tree automaton denoting the intersection of languages of given finite tree automata
- creating a finite tree automaton denoting the complement of the language of a given finite tree automaton
- Deterministaion: 
- Minimasation: 
- Reducing without Determinisation
- Determining inclusion while avoiding determinisation of any automaton.

# Representation (BDD)

.left-even-column[
Given the function:
    ![BDD function](./img/bdd_func.svg)
Decision tree and truth table:
    ![BDD tree](./img/BDD.png)
]

.right-even-column[
.text-center[
    Binary decision diagram:
]
    ![BDD2](./img/bdd_simple.svg)
]

???
- Binary decision diagram is a optimazed representation of a binary decision tree. It reduces both needed steps and size.
- Also represents the truth table
- In this example, given the function, we can see that if the x1 (first argument) is 1, we can already decide the end result based on the next choice, and therefore eliminate the need for the third arguemnt completly.

# Representation (BDD vs MTBDD)
Binary decision diagram vs Multi-terminal binary decision diagram
- BDD: f = {0, 1}n → {0, 1}
- MTBDD: g = {0, 1}n → D
.img70c[
    ![BDD vs MTBDD](./img/bdd_vs_mtbdd.svg)
]

BDD representing formula: `x1¬x3 + ¬x1x2¬x3 + ¬x1¬x2x3`

MTBDD representing formula: `¬x1¬x2¬x3A + x1x3B + ¬x1x2x3B`

???
- MTBDD is a generalisation of BDD
- The idea of the generalisation is to allow the sinknodes of the diagram to hold other values than 1 and 0.
- The values will instead be a part of a arbitrary domain D instead of {0, 1}.
- BDD, f : {0, 1}n → {0, 1}
- MTBDD, g : {0, 1}n → D
- In this example: TODO

# Representation (TA as MTBDD)

- A = (Q, F, Qf, ∆)
- Q = {q1, q2, q3}
- F = {a, b0, b2, c0, c1, d1}
- ∆ = {b0 → {q1,q2},c0 → {q2}, d1(q2) → {q3}, b2(q1, q3) → {q1, q2}, c1(q3) → {q1, q2}} 
- Encoding of F = a: 00, b: 01, c: 10, d: 11

.img50c[
    ![Representation of shared MTBDD](./img/representation_shared_mtbdd.svg)
]

???
- A = (Q, F, Qf, ∆)
- Q = {q1, q2, q3}
- F = {a, b0, b2, c0, c1, d1}
- ∆ = {b0 → {q1,q2},c0 → {q2}, d1(q2) → {q3}, b2(q1, q3) → {q1, q2}, c1(q3) → {q1, q2}} 
- Qf is not relevant in this case
- Dashed lines represent 0, solid lines represent 1
- This diagram represents the shared MTBDD of ∆(transitions)
- Encoding of F = a: 00, b: 01, c: 10, d: 11
- In this example: TODO

# Operations on MTBDDs
### Apply
- Performs a given binary operation on all respective sink nodes
```
Apply lhs rhs op = λx . op (lhs x) (rhs x)
```

### MonadicApply
- Performs a given unary operation on all sink nodes of a given MTBDD
```
MonadicApply tf op = λx . op (tf x)
```

???
The Lambda-calculus is used as a definition and applications of functions that work with MTBDDs.

### Apply
- The standard Apply function that performs a given binary operation op on all respective sink nodes (this means sink nodes accessible over the same symbol) of two input MTBDDs (lhs and rhs for left-hand side MTBDD and right-hand side MTBDD respectively) and returns the resulting MTBDD.

### MonadicApply
- The monadic version of Apply function that performs a given unary operation op on all sink nodes of input MTBDD tf and returns the resulting MTBDD.

# Operations on MTBDDs (Union)

$$ \Delta_\cup   \left (  \right ) := Apply (\Delta_1 ()) (\Delta_2 ()) (\lambda X Y . X \cup Y) $$
.img80c[
    ![Language union](./img/transition_union.svg)
]

???
- For efficiency the transition functions of the input automaton is reused as much as possible.
- TODO?
- Computations of Qu and Qfu are trivial
- Since all transitions are stored in a single shared MTBDD the computation only needs one apply
