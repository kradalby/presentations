# Tree Automata
- **Ranked alphabet**: A pair of an ordinary alphabet and a function for building terms

- **Bottom-up finite tree automaton**: A tuple (Q, F, Qf, Δ)
  - Q is a set of states
  - F is a ranked Alphabet
  - Qf is a set of final states
  - Δ is a set of transitions

- **Top-down finite tree automaton**: A tuple (Q, F, Qi, Δ)
  - Q is a set of states
  - F is a ranked Alphabet
  - Qi is a set of initial states
  - Δ is a set of transitions

???
- Alphabet: A set of symbols, a common alphabet is {0, 1}, the binary alphabet
- Ranged Alphabet: A pair of an ordinary alphabet and a function. Each symbol in the alphabet has its arity so it can be used to build terms.
- Bottom up: The members of Delta are rewrite rules from nodes whose child's roots are states, to nodes whose roots are states. Thus, the state of a node is deduced from the states of its children.
- Top-down: The members of Delta are rewrite rules from nodes whose roots are states to nodes whose child' roots are states.

# Timbuk

- Collection of tools for Term Rewriting Systems and Tree Automata
- Version 3.1 is latest (2.2 is the latest with TA)
- Written in OCaml by IRISA
- The code is open source (GNU LGPL v2)
- Tree automatons are implemented as tuple of lists

![Timbuk](./img/timbuk.svg)

???
- IRISA is a French research institute that focuses on computer science and informatics.
- 2.2 Version is patched by Ondreij to run a newer OCaml version.
- The code is open source, and the author states that he studied the implementation.
- The tuple consists of:
  - a list of symbols (an alphabet)
  - a list of state operators
  - a list of states
  - a list of final states
  - a list of transitions
  - a list of priority transitions
- Timbuk implements the "standard" operations:
  - Intersection
  - Union
  - Language emptiness
  - deletion of inaccessible states
  - Determinisation
  - others
- Timbuk can construct a tree automaton directly from a given term rewriting system.

# MONA

- Solves decision procedures for WS1S and WS2S
- Tree automata is a part of their "secrets"
  - More accurately, the representation
  - Introduces MTBDD
- Guided tree automaton
- Eager minimisation
- MONA only supports deterministic finite tree automata
- The code is open-source (GNU GPLv2)
- Written in C/C++ by BRICS/Aarhus University

.img50r[
    ![Tree](./img/tree.svg)
]

???
- WS1S (Weak monadic Second-order theory of 1 successor)
- WS2S (Weak monadic Second-order theory of 2 successors)
- MONA is heavily optimized over the years, and a co-author claims that MONA is tuned to give the "best" performance.
- MTBDD will be discussed more in-depth in the design part.
- Guided tree automaton helps tackle state space blow-up.
  - Bottom-up tree automaton often suffer from the lack of position information in the tree.
  - Guided tree automaton provides a guide, an additional top-down TA that labels tree nodes with state spaces (aware of position).
  - This is done before the automaton starts working.
- Eager minimisation
  - When the automaton is modified, a Myhill-Nerode minimisation is performed
    - Myhill-Nerode: TODO
  - Yielded unexpected good results.
  - MONA uses DAGs for representations instead of trees to represent formulae.
- AT&T is also avpart of the collaboration

# Analysis
## Abstract Regular Tree Model Checking

Regular tree model checking:
τ∗ (L(Init)) ∩ L(Bad) = ∅

- Abstract regular tree model checking
- Abstraction based on languages of finite height
- Abstraction based on predicate languages


???
- Where _Init_ is a tree automaton denoting the set of initial states of the system.
- Where _Bad_ is a tree automaton expressing the set of states violating the safety properties of the system.
- Where τ is a linear tree transducer representing the transition relation of the system.

- Abstract RTMC is an acceleration technique based on the _abstract-check-refine_ paradigm
- Abstraction based on languages of finite height defines two states of a tree automaton as equivalent if their languages up to a given height n are identical. Similar to Myhill-Nerode.
- Abstraction based on predicate languages defines two states of a tree automaton equivalent if their languages have a nonempty intersection with exactly the same subset of languages represented by tree automata from P.

---
# Analysis (2)

# Representation (BDD)

.left-even-column[
Given the function:
    ![BDD function](./img/bdd_func.svg)
Decision tree and truth table:
    ![BDD tree](./img/BDD.png)
]

.right-even-column[
.text-center[
    Binary decision diagram:
]
    ![BDD2](./img/bdd_simple.svg)
]

???
- Binary decision diagram is an optimized representation of a binary decision tree. It reduces both needed steps and size.
- Also represents the truth table
- In this example, given the function, we can see that if the x1 (first argument) is 1, we can already decide the end result based on the next choice, and therefore, eliminate the need for the third argument completely.

---
# Representation (BDD vs MTBDD)
Binary decision diagram vs Multi-terminal binary decision diagram
- BDD: f = {0, 1}n → {0, 1}
- MTBDD: g = {0, 1}n → D
.img70c[
    ![BDD vs MTBDD](./img/bdd_vs_mtbdd.svg)
]

BDD representing formula: `x1¬x3 + ¬x1x2¬x3 + ¬x1¬x2x3`

MTBDD representing formula: `¬x1¬x2¬x3A + x1x3B + ¬x1x2x3B`

???
- MTBDD is a generalization of BDD
- The idea of the generalization is to allow the sink nodes of the diagram to hold other values than 1 and 0.
- The values will instead be a part of an arbitrary domain D instead of {0, 1}.
- BDD, f : {0, 1}n → {0, 1}
- MTBDD, g : {0, 1}n → D
- In this example: TODO

# Representation (TA as MTBDD)

- A = (Q, F, Qf, ∆)
- Q = {q1, q2, q3}
- F = {a, b0, b2, c0, c1, d1}
- ∆ = {b0 → {q1,q2},c0 → {q2}, d1(q2) → {q3}, b2(q1, q3) → {q1, q2}, c1(q3) → {q1, q2}}
- Encoding of F = a: 00, b: 01, c: 10, d: 11

.img50c[
    ![Representation of shared MTBDD](./img/representation_shared_mtbdd.svg)
]

???
- A = (Q, F, Qf, ∆)
- Q = {q1, q2, q3}
- F = {a, b0, b2, c0, c1, d1}
- ∆ = {b0 → {q1,q2},c0 → {q2}, d1(q2) → {q3}, b2(q1, q3) → {q1, q2}, c1(q3) → {q1, q2}}
- Qf is not relevant in this case
- Dashed lines represent 0, solid lines represent 1
- This diagram represents the shared MTBDD of ∆(transitions)
- Encoding of F = a: 00, b: 01, c: 10, d: 11
- In this example: TODO

# Operations on MTBDDs
### Apply
- Performs a given binary operation on all respective sink nodes
```
Apply lhs rhs op = λx . op (lhs x) (rhs x)
```

### MonadicApply
- Performs a given unary operation on all sink nodes of a given MTBDD
```
MonadicApply tf op = λx . op (tf x)
```

???
The Lambda-calculus is used as a definition and applications of functions that work with MTBDDs.

### Apply
- The standard Apply function that performs a given binary operation op on all respective sink nodes (this means sink nodes accessible over the same symbol) of two input MTBDDs (lhs and rhs for left-hand side MTBDD and right-hand side MTBDD respectively) and returns the resulting MTBDD.

### MonadicApply
- The monadic version of Apply function that performs a given unary operation op on all sink nodes of input MTBDD tf and returns the resulting MTBDD.

---
# Operations on MTBDDs (Union)

$$ \Delta_\cup   \left (  \right ) := Apply (\Delta_1 ()) (\Delta_2 ()) (\lambda X Y . X \cup Y) $$


.img80c[
    ![Language union](./img/transition_union.svg)
]

???
- For efficiency, the transition functions of the input automaton are reused as much as possible.
- TODO?
- Computations of Qu and Qfu are trivial
- Since all transitions are stored in a single shared MTBDD the computation only needs one apply

---
# Operations on MTBDDs (Intersection)

TODO $$ A_\cap := \left (Q_1 \times Q_2, F, Q_{f1} \times Q_{f2}, \Delta\cap \right ) $$

.img80c[
    ![Language intersection](./img/transition_intersection.svg)
]

???
- First, construct the product of the two automaton
- The result for AIntersect only contains reachable states and transitions.
- Detection of reachable states is done by starting from initial super-states of automata.
- Analyzing all transition and collecting states that may be reached until there is no unanalysed.


---
# Tree Transducer
- Defined as a tuple (Q, F, F', Qf, ∆)
- Where:
  - Q is a set of states: $$ Q \cap F = \emptyset , Q \cap F' = \emptyset $$
  - F and F' are finite nonempty sets of input and output symbols
  - Qf is a set of final states
  - ∆ is a set of transduction rules
- In our library, we use relabelling tree transducers

???
- Bottum up tree transducers are defined as (Q, F, F', Qf, ∆)
- Relabelling tree transducers, aka structure-preserving TT.
- This type does not change the structure of the nodes but changes the symbols.

---
# Performing transduction step (Algorithm)

$ A = (Q_A, F, Q_fA, \Delta_A) $ $ t = (Q_t, F, Q_ft, \Delta_t) $

- Assume that transition function $ \Delta_A $ is defined over Bool variables $ x_1 .... x_n $
- Assume that transition function $ \Delta_t $ is defined over Bool variables $ y_1 .... y_n $
- $ x_1 .... x_n $ is used for input for the transducer
- $ y_1 .... y_n $ is used for output for the transducer
- The MTBDDs for the outbut automaton is over bool variables $ x_1 .... x_y $
- The algorithm will traverse the automaton and transducer in parallel
- Relabelling the transitions which resided in both

---
# Performing transduction step (Example)

.img70c[
    ![Performing transduction step](./img/transduction_step.svg)
]
An example of performing transduction step of transducer t on automaton A for one pair of super-states $s_t$ and $s_A$, such that $01(s_A)$ → A, $10(s_A) → B$, and $0X(s_t) → 3(1X)$, $10(s_t) → 7(01)$. Ordering $(a_1, b_1, . . . , a_n, b_n)$ is used.

# MTBDD Package

.img50c[
    ![CUDD wrapper for MTBDD](./img/cudd_wrapper.svg)
]

???
- It was not trivial to write an MTBDD implementation for the Project
- CUDD, (Colorado University Decision Diagram Package) was selected.
- It implements shared:
  - BDD
  - ADD (Algebraic decision diagrams)
  - ZDD (zero-suppressed decision diagram)
- In the library, the MTBDD is represented by an ADD
- ADD is an MTBDD which puts emphasis on performing algebraic operations:
  - addition
  - multiplication
  - computation of logarithm
- The internal usage in the library is only for storage, data retrieval and performing apply
- CUDD only allows floating point numbers, so the library deals with the problem of substituting the float for sets of states of an automaton.
- This is solved by patching CUDD so sink nodes can contain pointers to another data structure.
- Which serves as a pool of sets of stats
- To use MTBDDs space reduction, it must hold that there are never two equal sets in the states in the pool.
- This means that two pointers point to the same set of states if and only if they are equal.

---
# Object-Oriented Design

- Language: C++
  - Object-orientation
  - Efficient
  - Extensive standard library

![Binding of policy classes](./img/binding_policy.svg)

???
- Policy based Design
- This approach uses policy classes which cannot (should not)  be instantiated.
- Each policy should provide some functionality, which is used in host classes to provide a complete type
- The policy classes are implemented as interfaces and the host class is implemented as a template.
- The policy classes of a host class are resolved statically during compile time.
- The author argues that this will allow the compiler optimize for faster Code
- Advantage over using virtual methods

---
# MTBDD Wrapper

- Wrapper around CUDD Library
- Simplified and minimal API

![Cudd interface](./img/cudd_interface.svg)

???
- CUDDFacade is a class following the facade design pattern.
- Simplifying the access to CUDD which provides an extensive and confusing API.
- CUDDFacade provides a clean, minimal and type-safe interface with only the minimal operations needed by the library.
- CUDDSharedMTBDD is an object-oriented representation of the shared MTBDD
- CUDDFacade is the middleman between CUDD and CUDDSharedMTBDD, ref illustration.

# Tree Automaton
- The tree automaton is represented as a class `TreeAutomaton`
- Provides high-level interface
  - Allows the use of human-readable names of states and symbols
  - Provides mapping for the inner representations
  - Enables adding of state, transition and marking a state final
- Supports importing and exporting tree automaton to and from a file.

.img30r[
    ![File](./img/file.svg)

# Automaton import

- Generic and extendable class for building of Tree Automata
- Currently implemented with `TimbukTABuilder`

.img80c[
    ![TABuildingDirector](./img/ta_building.svg)
]

???
- Supports a Timbuk like file format
- To go along with the reading from file feature

---
# Automaton export

.left-even-column[
- Difficult to extract transitions from symbolic to explicit
- This was achieved by setting each boolean variable to X
- And attempt to bind it to 0 or 1

- States are represented as circles
- Final states as double circles
- Super-states are rectangles with boxes

]

.right-even-column[
.img70c[
    ![Graphical representation of tree automaton](./img/ta_graphical.svg)
]
]

???
- If the value remains X, it is not an important value
- The conversation is over when all boolean variables have been checked.
